## 🛠️ How It Works
- On **push** to `main` or a **pull request**, the workflow runs.
- It installs Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`) and runs all tests inside the `tests/` folder.
- The results are shown in the **Actions** tab.

## 📜 Usage
Ensure your test files are inside `tests/`, and the main testbench file is properly configured.
