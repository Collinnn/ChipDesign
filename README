### 🔘 **Trigger a Manual Test**
To manually run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[GitHub Actions Page](https://github.com/Collinnn/ChipDesign/actions/workflows/blank.yml)**.
2. Click the **"Run workflow"** button.
3. Select the branch and click **"Run workflow"**.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- On **push** to `main` or a **pull request**, the workflow runs.
- It installs Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`) and runs all tests inside the `tests/` folder.
- The results are shown in the **Actions** tab.

## 📜 Usage
Ensure your test files are inside `tests/`, and the main testbench file is properly configured.
